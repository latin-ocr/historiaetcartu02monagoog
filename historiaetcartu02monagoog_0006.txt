Os· the toth of J anuary 1857, the blaster ol the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materials for the History of this Country from the
Inrasiou ol the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The blaster ot' the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected t'or publication under competent
editors without reference'to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
enee being giren, in the first instance, to such materials
as were most scarce and raluable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historica] docu-
ment ιο be eata should be natea in ue same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose thc most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation of the best MSS.

'lo render the work more generally useful, the blastcr
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should gire an
account ol the MSS. employed hy him, of their age and
their peculiarities ; that hc should add to the work a
brief account of the lit'e and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 bnt no
other note or comment was to be allowed, except what
might be necessary to establish the correctness of the

text.
